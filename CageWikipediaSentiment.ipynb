       "'Since his film debut with a minor role in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), opposite Judge Reinhold and Sean Penn, Cage has appeared in a wide range of films, both mainstream and offbeat.He auditioned for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle film The Outsiders, based on S.E.Hinton novel, but lost to Matt Dillon.He was also in Coppola films Rumble Fish and Peggy Sue Got Married.Other Cage roles included appearances in the acclaimed 1987 romantic-comedy film Moonstruck, also starring Cher; the Coen Brothers cult-classic comedy Raising Arizona; David Lynch 1990 film Wild at Heart; a lead role in Martin Scorsese 1999 New York City paramedic drama Bringing Out the Dead; and Ridley Scott 2003 black comedy crime film Matchstick Men, in which he played a con artist with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Cage at the 66th Venice Film Festival in September 2009 Cage has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, winning once for his performance as a suicidal alcoholic in Leaving Las Vegas.His other nomination was for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman fictional twin Donald in Adaptation.Despite these successes, most of his lower-profile films have performed poorly at the box office compared to his mainstream action/adventure roles.The suspense thriller 8mm (1999) is considered a cult film.He took the lead role in the 2001 film Captain Corelli Mandolin and learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part.He made his directorial debut with 2002 Sonny.In 2005, two films he headlined, Lord of War and The Weather Man, failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his performances.Poor reviews for The Wicker Man resulted in low box office sales.The much criticized Ghost Rider (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, fared better, earning more than $45 million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208 million worldwide through the weekend ending on March 25, 2007.Also in 2007, he starred in Next, which shared the concept of a glimpse into an alternate timeline with Cage film, The Family Man (2000).Most of Cage movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre.In his second-highest-grossing film to date, National Treasure, he plays an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States.Other action hits include The Rock, in which Cage plays a young FBI chemical weapons expert who infiltrates Alcatraz Island in the hope of neutralizing a terrorist threat, Face/Off, a John Woo film where he plays both a hero and a villain, and World Trade Center, director Oliver Stone film about the September 11 attacks.He had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu in Rob Zombie fake trailer Werewolf Women of the S.S. from the B-movie double feature Grindhouse.In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a Ring of Honor wrestling show in New York City researching for the lead role for The Wrestler.However, Cage dropped out of production shortly afterward because he felt that he did not have enough time to prepare for the role and director Darren Aronofsky preferred Mickey Rourke for the lead part.Rourke would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance.In an interview with slashfilm.com, Aronofsky said of Cage decision to leave the film that \"Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside.I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.\"   Cage at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International In 2008, Cage appeared as Joe, a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok, in the film Bangkok Dangerous.The film is shot by the Pang Brothers and has a distinctly South-East Asian flavor.In 2009, Cage starred in the science fiction thriller Knowing, directed by Alex Proyas.In the film, he plays an MIT professor who examines the contents of a time capsule unearthed at his son elementary school.Startling predictions found inside the capsule that has already come true lead him to believe that the world is going to end at the close of the week and that he and his son are somehow involved in the destruction.The film received mainly negative reviews but was the box office winner on its opening weekend.Also in 2009, Cage starred in the film The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, directed by acclaimed German director Werner Herzog.He portrayed a corrupt police officer with gambling, drug and alcohol addictions.The film was very well received by critics, holding a rating of 87% positive reviews on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.Cage was lauded for his performance, with Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune writing \"Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest.\" This film reunited Cage with Eva Mendes, who played his love interest in Ghost Rider.In 2010, Cage starred in the period piece Season of the Witch, playing a 14th-century knight transporting a girl accused of causing the Black Plague to a monastery, and The Sorcerer Apprentice, in which he played the sorcerer.In 2012, Cage reprised his role in Ghost Rider sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.He voiced the character Grug Crood in the animated film The Croods, which was released in 2013.The Croods received positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $585 million against a budget of $135 million.In the same year he starred as main character in The Frozen Ground, a thriller crime drama film directed and written by Scott Walker in his directorial debut, based on the crimes of real-life Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen: The film depicts an Alaskan State Trooper, played by Cage, seeking to apprehend Hansen by partnering with a young woman, who escaped from Hansen clutches.The film has received mixed reviews though Cage performance was cited as a highlight and solid.In 2013 he also starred in Joe, an independent crime drama film directed and co-produced by David Gordon Green, adaptation from Larry Brown 1991 novel of the same name.In this film Nicolas Cage is a tormented man who hires a 15-year-old boy (played by Tye Sheridan) and protects him from his abusive father.The film premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 30, 2013, with a subsequent screening at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.It was a box office flop, grossing only $2.36 million from a $4 million budget, but received critical acclaim from critics, who praised Cage performance and Green direction.Cage starred alongside Selma Blair and Anne Winters in Brian Taylor horror comedy film, Mom and Dad, which premiered in the Midnight Madness section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival.It was released in theaters on January 19, 2018, and received positive reviews from critics, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes defining his performance as \"over-the-top.\" Director John Waters appreciated the film, naming Mom and Dad as one of the best movies of 2018, placing it fourth on his personal top list.Cage at the 2016 Oldenburger International Film Festival In 2018, Cage starred in the action thriller film, Mandy, which premiered on January 19 at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com praised the movie, writing that \"for all of the endless feral performances that Cage has given, in movies good, bad and forgettable, Cosmatos\\' style-driven, \\'80s-tastic passion for weird worlds and characters takes full advantage of Cage greatness, and then some.\" On October, Mandy producer Elijah Wood announced the intention to sizing up an Oscar campaign for Nicolas Cage and for composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (who died in February of that year) but the film was disqualified because was also released on VOD on September 14.Later that year, Cage voiced Superman in the animated film Teen Titans Go!To the Movies.He had originally been slated to portray Superman in Tim Burton canceled Superman film, Superman Lives, in the 1990s.He also voiced Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Cage based his character, a dark and monochromatic alternate version of Peter Parker from a 1930s universe, on the films of Humphrey Bogart, specifically the voices of actors from that era such as James Cagney and Edward G.Robinson.On January 28, 2019, Viktor and Irina Yelchin premiered a documentary about their son Anton Yelchin, Love, Antosha, at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.The documentary was directed by Garret Price and contains various interviews with some of Anton’s friends and collaborators like Kristen Stewart, J.J. Abrams, Chris Pine, Jennifer Lawrence, Jodie Foster, John Cho and Martin Landau.Cage starred as the Narrator of the film, reading various Anton writings.'"
