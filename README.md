# Nic Cage Dataset

nic-cage.csv is a dataset I have curated containing information about Nic Cage movies. It has a list of all released Nic Cage acting roles, gathered from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/#actor). I have included the movie, character name, whether the role was live action or voice acting, and the Rotten Tomatoes score. Data was gathered on January, 2019 and has been updated on August 7th, 2019.

Movie, rating, and character are all strings with movie title, movie rating, and character name, respectively.
Voice is binary: 0 indicates live action and 1 indicates a voice acting role.
Year is numerical.
Rotten Tomatoes Score is a combination of numerical and character data. If a score was not available, that space was filled with "X".
