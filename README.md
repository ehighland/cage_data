# Nic Cage Dataset

nic-cage.csv is a dataset I have curated containing information about Nic Cage movies. It has a list of all Nic Cage acting roles, gathered from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/#actor). I have included the movie, character name, whether the role was live action or voice acting, and the Rotten Tomatoes score. Data was gathered on January 28th of 2019 and has not been updated since that time.

Movie and character are both strings with movie title and character name respectively.
Voice is binary: 0 indicates live action and 1 indicates a voice acting role.
Year is numerical.
Rotten Tomatoes Score is a combination of numerical and character data. If a score was not available, that space was filled with "X".
